  <p>When we first set out to apply deep learning to genomics, we asked ourselves what the current state of the art is. What problems are researchers working on and what approaches are they using? This post contains a summary of what we found â€” an overview of popular network architectures in genomics, the types of data used to train deep models, and the outcomes predicted or inferred.</p>
