  <p>At Qure.ai, we have always taken a holistic approach towards building solutions for lung health. qXR provides automated interpretation of chest X-rays and is complemented by qTrack, an AI powered disease management platform. In this blog, we unveil our next product qCT-Lung â€“ an AI powered automated analysis of Chest CTs. It can detect findings like lung nodules &amp; emphysema and analyse their malignancy. We will add more findings to qCT-Lung in coming days.</p>
