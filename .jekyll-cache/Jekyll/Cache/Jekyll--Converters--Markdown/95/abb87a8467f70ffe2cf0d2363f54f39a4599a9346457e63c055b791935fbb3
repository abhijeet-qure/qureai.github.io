I"Ô<p>At Qure.ai, our mission is to make healthcare more affordable and accessible using the power of deep learning. Deep learning is transforming how machines learn - from having to hand-craft features to machines automatically learning features from labeled data. Recently, deep learning has been able to perform well on tasks which require human expertise gained over years of training. Some of these include driving cars, playing games such as Go, diagnosing medical images, writing poetry or drawing paintings. The advantage machines have here is that they can go through 10,000 CT Scan images or play 100,000 games in a matter of a few hours, a number which might take a human several years or even a whole lifetime.</p>
