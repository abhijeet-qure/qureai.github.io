  <p>At Qure.ai, we have always taken a holistic approach towards building solutions for lung health. qXR provides automated interpretation of chest X-rays and is complemented by qTrack, an AI powered disease management platform. In this blog, we unveil our next product qCT-Lung â€“ an AI powered automated analysis of Chest CTs. It can detect findings like lung nodules &amp; emphysema and analyse their malignancy. We will add more findings to qCT-Lung in coming days.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Medical Imaging has seen the biggest healthcare advancements in artificial intelligence and lung health has been at the forefront of these improvements. Lung health has been a key sector for our product portfolio. Weâ€™ve built AI algorithms like <em>qXR</em>, which provides automated interpretation of chest X-rays. We augmented its capabilities with <em>qTrack</em> â€“ our AI powered disease management platform, which solves for active case finding &amp; tracking patients in care pathways. These applications have empowered healthcare practitioners at all stages of the patient journey through TB, Covid-19 &amp; lung cancer screenings.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re adding a new member to our lung health portfolio: <em>qCT-Lung</em>. Its AI-powered algorithms can interpret chest CTs for findings like lung nodules &amp; emphysema, and analyze their malignancy. It empowers clinicians to detect lung cancer in both screening programs as well as opportunistic screening settings.</p>

<p><em>qXR</em>â€™s &amp; <em>qCT-Lung</em>â€™s abilities to detect lung cancer in chest x-rays &amp; CTs complement <em>qTrack</em>â€™s disease management &amp; patient tracking capability. Together, they round up our lung health portfolio to make it a comprehensive, powerful &amp; unique offering.</p>

<h1 id="lung-cancer---the-most-fatal-cancer">Lung Cancer - The most fatal cancer</h1>

<p>Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in both men &amp; women.  2.2 million people were diagnosed with lung cancer worldwide in 2020 [1]. With 1.74 million deaths in 2020, lung cancer is also the leading cause of cancer related deaths (18.4%) resulting inmore deaths than the second (colorectal - 9.2%) and third (stomach 8.2%) deadliest cancers combined.</p>

<p>Future projections donâ€™t look good either. Lung cancer incidents are projected to rise by 38%  and the mortality is projected to rise by 39%  by 2030.[2]</p>

<p>There are two main types of lung cancer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): NSCLC comprises of 80-85% of all lung cancer cases. Their major subtypes are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. They are grouped together because of shared similarity in treatment &amp; prognoses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC): SCLC tends to grow and spread faster than NSCLC. 10-15% of all lung cancers are SCLC</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are also cancers that start in other organs (like breast) and spread to lung, but they donâ€™t come under the vicinity of lung cancer.</p>
