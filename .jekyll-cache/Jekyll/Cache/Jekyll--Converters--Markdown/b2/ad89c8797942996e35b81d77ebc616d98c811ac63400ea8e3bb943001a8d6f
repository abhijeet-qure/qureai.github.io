I"è<p>At Qure, we‚Äôre building deep learning systems which help diagnose abnormalities from medical images. Most of the deep learning models are classification models which predict a probability of abnormality from a scan. However, just the probability score of the abnormality doesn‚Äôt amount much to a radiologist if it‚Äôs not accompanied by a visual interpretation of the model‚Äôs decision.</p>
