  <p>Medical Imaging has seen the biggest healthcare advancements in artificial intelligence and lung health has been at the forefront of theseimprovements. At Qure.ai, we take a holistic approach towards building solutions for lung health. Weâ€™ve built AI algorithms like qXR, which provides automated interpretation of chest X-rays. We complemented it with qTrack â€“ our AI powered disease management platform, which solves for active case finding &amp; tracking patients in care pathways. These applications have empowered healthcare practitioners at all stages of the patient journey through TB, Covid-19 &amp; lung cancer screenings.qXRâ€™s &amp; qCT-Lungâ€™s abilities to detect lung cancer in chest x-rays &amp; CTs complement qTrackâ€™s disease management &amp; patient tracking capability. Together, they round up our lung health portfolio to make it a comprehensive, powerful &amp; unique offering.</p>
