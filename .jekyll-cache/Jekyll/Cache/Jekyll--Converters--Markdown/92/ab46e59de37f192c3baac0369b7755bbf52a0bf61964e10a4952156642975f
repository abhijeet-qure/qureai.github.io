  <p>At Qure.ai, we have always taken a holistic approach towards building solutions for lung health. <em>qXR</em> provides automated interpretation of chest X-rays and is complemented by <em>qTrack</em>, an AI powered disease management platform. In this blog, we unveil our next product <em>qCT-Lung</em> â€“ an AI powered automated analysis of Chest CTs. It can detect findings like lung nodules &amp; emphysema and analyse their malignancy. We will add more findings to <em>qCT-Lung</em> in coming days.</p>
