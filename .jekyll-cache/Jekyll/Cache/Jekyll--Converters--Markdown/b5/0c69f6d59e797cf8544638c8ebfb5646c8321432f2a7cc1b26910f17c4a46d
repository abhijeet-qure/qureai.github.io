  <p>Unsupervised learning is about inferring hidden structure from unlabelled data. There is no supervision in the form of labels, so the model has to figure out how to represent the data and find patterns in it. When we have large quantities of data, and none or few labels, the most effective technique is to use unsupervised methods to learn from data.</p>
