I"T<p>We have recently published an <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31645-3/fulltext">article</a> on our deep learning algorithms for Head CT in <em>The Lancet</em>. This article is the first ever AI in medical imaging paper to be published in this journal.
We described development and validation of these algorithms in the article.
In this blog, I explain some of the challenges we faced in this process and how we solved them. The challenges I describe are fairly general and should be applicable to any research involving AI and radiology images.</p>
