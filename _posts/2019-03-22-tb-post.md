> This blog is second in the series on challenges in deploying deep learning solutions for radiology. We had talked about the technical aspects of these challenges in our [first blog](http://blog.qure.ai/notes/deploying-deep-learning-for-radiology). Here, we will talk about the operational hurdles in one of our deployments being used to fast-track Tuberculosis screening.


<!-- TODO -->
Qure.ai’s deep learning solutions are actively reading radiology images in over 70 (CheckWithReshma) sites spread across 10 (CheckWithReshma) countries. We have processed more than 50 (CheckWithReshma) thousand scans till date. One of the major use cases of our solutions is for fast-tracking Tuberculosis screening.


### Understanding Tuberculosis


Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria called as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and it mostly affect the lungs. About one-fourth of world’s population are infected by the bacteria but it is not active yet – a condition called latent TB. TB infection occurs when a person breathes in droplets produced due to an active TB person’s coughing, sneezing or spitting.

<!-- TODO: references -->
TB is a [curable and preventable disease](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis). Despite that, [WHO reports](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis) that it is one of the top 10 causes of deaths worldwide. In 2017, 10 million people fell ill with TB, out of which 1.6 million lost their lives. 1 million children got affected by it, with 230,000 fatalities. It is the leading cause of death among HIV patients.

#### Diagnosis of TB
There are a range of tests to detect TB. Some of them are as follows:

* Chest X-ray: They are used to detect inflammation in the lungs due to TB. An abnormal shadow might be visible on the x-ray. Further confirmatory tests like ones below are carried if x-ray is suspected to be positive for TB.
* Sputum test: It involves microscopic tests of sputum (phlegm). This test also helps in understanding how infectious a patient is.
* Molecular tests: Tests like Genexpert and TrueNat fall under this category. These are fairly expensive tests.


Molecular tests have shown [excellent results in South Africa](https://www.tbfacts.org/tb-south-africa-hiv/)  and are generally considered as the go-to test for TB. However, their high costs make it impossible to conduct them for every TB suspect.

#### Failure in early detection
Due to the high costs of molecular tests, generally Chest x-rays are preferred as pre-test for TB suspects. Post that, sputum or molecular tests are performed for confirmation. In regions where these confirmatory tests are not available, Chest x-rays are used for final diagnosis.

Having understood chest x-rays’ key role in TB diagnosis, it is important to note that there is a huge dearth of radiologists to read these x-rays. In India alone, 80 million chest x-rays are being captured every year. There aren’t enough radiologists to read them within acceptable timelines. Depending upon the extent of lack of radiology expertise, it can take anywhere between 2 to 15 days for the report to arrive. This leads into critical time being lost for a TB patient thereby preventing early detection of TB.

Moreover, the error rates in reading these x-rays [lie around 25-30%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609674). An error in reading a TB suspect’s chest x-ray can be fatal for the patient.

#### Where Qure.ai comes into the picture

This large gap between number of TB incidences and number of timely reported cases is a major reason why so many lives are lost to this curable disease. The gap can be bridged with a solution that requires little manual intervention. This is precisely how Qure’s qXR solution, trained on more than a million Chest x-rays, attacks at the heart of the problem. The AI (Artificial Intelligence) encapsulated inside qXR automates reading chest x-rays and generates reports within seconds. Thereby, reducing the waiting time for TB confirmatory tests from weeks to couple of hours and enrolling confirmed cases to treatment the same day!

While bacteriological confirmatory tests on presumptive cases is preferred in screening setting, the cost burden increases. Sputum culture testing will take weeks for the reports that could result in drop outs collecting reports and treatment enrolment. Additionally, shortage of sourcing Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CB-NAAT) becomes a limitation resulting in delay of testing process. Qure.ai’s qXR helps in cutting down on costs incurred and time by reducing the number of individuals required to go through these tests. The whole program work flow can happen as depicted in the following picture.

### Case Study: AccessTB, Philippines

While upscaling our solutions in last 2 years, it has become evident that Qure.ai can play an extremely vital role in humanity’s war against TB. We deployed qXR with ACCESS TB Project in Philippines in their Tuberculosis screening program. During the deployment, we learned the operational dynamics of deploying deep learning at health centers.

#### TB screening process before incorporating qXR

The ACCESS TB program has mobile vans equipped with X-rays machines with trained radiographers and health workers as a part of their screening programme. The program is intended to screen presumptive cases and individuals with high risk factor of Tuberculosis, by running the vans across different cities in Philippines. Screening camps are either announced in conjunction with a nearby nursing home or health workers identify and invite individuals at risk on the days of programs.

The vans leave the office on Monday morning for remote villages around Philippines with a predefined schedule. These villages are situated around 100kms from Manilla. 2 radiology technicians accompany each van. Once they reach the desired health center in the village, they start capturing x-rays for each individual. The x-ray machines are connected to a computer which stores these x-rays locally. One can also edit the dicom (radiology image) information inside the x-ray from this computer.

Individuals arrive inside the van on a first come first serve basis. They are given a receipt containing their patient id, name etc. Their x-ray is also marked with the same ID using the computer. This approach of mass screening for TB is similar to the approach adopted by USA during 1930s to 1960s as depicted in the following picture.

Once all the x-rays have been captured, the vans return to their stay in the same village. They visit a new village/ health center on subsequent weekdays. On Friday evening, all the vans return to Manila. Thereafter, all the x-rays captured in the 4 vans over the week are sent to a Radiologist for review. The lead time for the Radiologist report is between 3 working days and can extend upto 2 weeks. The delay in reporting leads to delay in diagnosis and treatment, which can prove to be fatal for the patient and the neighbourhood.

#### Challenges for Qure.ai

Qure’s team arrived in Manila during the second week of September. Our deep learning solution sitting nice and cozy on the cloud. The major challenges in front of us were two-fold:

1. To ensure smooth upload of images to our cloud server.
This was a challenge because some of the villages and towns being visited were very remote and there was no guarantee of sufficient internet connection for the upload to work properly. We had to make sure that everything worked fine even if there was no internet connectivity. To deal with this, we built an application which was installed on their computer to upload images on our cloud. In case of no internet connectivity, it would store all the information and wait for better connectivity. As soon as connectivity became available, the app would start processing deferred uploads.


2. To enable end to end patient management on one single platform.
This was the biggest concern and we designed the software to minimise manual intervention at various stages.


#### How we overcame these challenges

We built a single portal where radiology assistants could register individuals, radiologists could report on them and patient history could be maintained. The diagnosis from the radiologist, qXR and CB-NAAT tests are all accumulated at a single place.

Features that could ease the workflow were added to the software that enabled the staff in field to search for individuals by name, date or filter individuals by site or health center. We believe such feature addition and provisions in the software helped the staff to capture the progress of screening about an individual with a simple search using patient ID.

#### Implementation process

At Qure, we deliver our products and solutions understanding the customer needs and designing workflows to fit into their existing processes. Especially when it comes to mass screening programs, we understand that each of them are uniquely designed by Program managers and strategists and requires some form of customisation to deliver a seamless experience.

Post understanding existing workflow and the software design included elements that can automate some of the existing process. With design and engineering, the software was built, tested, packaged and stored in a secure cloud.
We figured the best way to integrate with their existing X-ray console and completed the integration on all the vans in 2 working days’ time.

A field visit was arranged post deployment to assess how the software performs in areas with limited network connectivity and the adaptability of staff to a new software based process. We even made customisations in the software workflow based on our learning from field at the same time!

The implementation process ended with a training and this time, we had a classroom training with the field staff, technicians and program managers .With completion of the deployment, software adaptability assessment and training, we handed over the software to the program in 5 days before we left Manila.

Quoting Preetham Srinivas (AI scientist at Qure) on qXR, “With qXR at the heart of it, we’ve developed a solution that is end to end. As in, with individual registrations, and then qXR does the automated analysis and flags individuals who need microbiological confirmation. Radiologists can verify in the same portal and then, an organization doing the microbiological tests can plug in their data in the same portal. And once you have a dashboard which collates all this information in one place, it becomes very powerful. The loss itself can be minimized. It becomes that much easier to track the person and make sure he is receiving the treatment.”

### Conclusion

WHO has given the status of an epidemic to TB (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis). They adopted an END TB strategy in 2014. The goal is to reduce TB deaths by 90% and to cut new cases by 80% between 2015 and 2030. Ending TB by 2030 is one of the health targets of the Sustainable Development Goals.

The scale of this epidemic cries out for technology to intervene. Technologies like AI, if incorporated into existing TB care ecosystem, can not only provide massive help to healthcare practitioners, but also enrich it by the supplied data and feedback. And this is not a mere speculation. With qXR, we are having a first hand experience of how AI can prove to be a lethal weapon for the fight against TB. Jerome Trinona, account coordinator for AccessTB project, says “Qure.ai’s complete TB software is very helpful in maximizing our time – now we can keep track of the entire patient workflow in one place.”
