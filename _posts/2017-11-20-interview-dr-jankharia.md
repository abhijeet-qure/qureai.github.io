> Dr Bhavin Jankharia is one of India's leading radiologists, former president of the IRIA as well as a  renowned educator, speaker and writer. Dr Jankharia's imaging practice, “Picture This by Jankharia”, is known for being an early adopter of innovation and for pioneering new technologies in radiology.

Q&A with Dr Jankharia on artificial intelligence in radiology.

### How do you see Artificial Intelligence in radiology evolving in the future?

AI is here to stay and will be a major factor to shape radiology over the next 10 years. It will be incorporated in some form or the other in protocols and workflows across the spectrum of radiology work and across the globe.

### You have been an early adopter of AI in your practice. What would your advice be to other institutions globally who are considering incorporating AI into their workflow?

t is about questions that need to be answered. At present, AI is good at solving specific questions or given numerical data from CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis with respect to bone density and aortic size, etc. Wherever there is a need for such issues to be addresses, AI should be incorporated into those specific workflows. We still haven’t gotten to the stage where AI can report every detail in every scan and that may actually never happen.

### Now that you have experienced AI in practice, how would you differentiate this technology from traditional CAD solutions that have been around for a while?

AI learns much faster and the basic approach is different. To the end user though, it matters not, does it, how we get the answer we want...

### How do you think the Qure.ai solutions can help or are helping radiologists in their practice?

They are slowly saving time and helping radiologists work smarter and better.

### What is your advice to young radiologists who are just getting started on their career? How should they think about adopting AI in their practice and should they be doing anything differently to succeed as a radiologist 10-20 years from now?

I don’t radiologists per se have to do anything about AI, unless they want to change track and work in the field of AI from a technical perspective. AI incorporation into workflow will happen anyway and like all changes to radiology workflow over the decades, it will become routine and a way of life. They don’t really need to do anything different, except be willing to except change.
